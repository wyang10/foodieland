At the `db` folder, we have provided 2 JSON files to be used as a collection for the database.
1. foodiehouse.json
2. login.json

#### Creating local database
Before running the program we first need to create a local database.
Run the following command in your terminal to start local mongo server: `mongod --dbpath ~/data/db`
Keeping the local server running, open a new terminal and run the following to create nomadLocalDB database and import the given JSON files as collections:
1. Projects collection
```
mongoimport -h localhost:27017 -d foodDB -c login --drop --jsonArray --file ./db/login.json 
```
2. Users collection
```
mongoimport -h localhost:27017 -d foodDB -c foodiehouse --drop --jsonArray --file ./db/foodiehouse.json 
```
NOTE: In `./db/myMongoDB.js` make sure the global constant is saying `DB_NAME = "foodDB"`, otherwise the program cannot find the local database.

#### Running locally
Once the local database has been created, follow these steps to run locally:
1. Run Mongo server: `mongod --dbpath ~/data/db`
2. Run client server: `npm start`
3. Using your browser go to localhost: http://locahost:3001/
